# Next.js: Error when navigating directly to a page that depends on data fetched on another page

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where navigating directly to a page that relies on data fetched on another page causes an error.

## Problem

The `about.js` page attempts to access user data from `localStorage`.  If a user navigates directly to `/about`, `localStorage` will be empty leading to an error (likely `JSON.parse: unexpected token` or a similar error).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data required by the `about` page is either available when the page loads or fetched independently. This might involve using server-side rendering, fetching data on the client-side (e.g., `useEffect` in React), or providing a fallback UI to display while data is being fetched.  See the solution branch for example.
